== Description ==

Allow pages to be given tags just as if they were posts.

This plugin is designed to easily allow you to display related posts on a page (by checking to see if they have matching tags), not to show the pages under the tag archives by default. (Although there is a setting for that)

The purpose of this is to easily allow the site editor to 'relate' pages to posts using a process they are familiar with.

== Installation ==

Upload the tomi-page-tags folder to the wp-content/plugins directory

Enable "Tomi Page Tagging" in the plugins section

== Instructions ==

Once the plugin is enabled you will be able to add tags to pages without any further configuration
